### PASSNYC Data Science for Good
<b>Objective:</b> Analyze PASSNYC data to study the student demographic in NYC appearing for the SHSAT annually and if possible, 
make recommendations to increase the diversity of the SHSAT candidate pool. PASSNYC is a not for profit organization 
based in NYC which strives towards serving the talented and underrepresented student community of NYC. <br>
<br>
PASSNYC uses public data to identify students within New York Cityâ€™s under-performing school districts and, through consulting and collaboration with partners, 
aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing their efforts in under-performing areas that are
historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, they strive to pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students. <br>

Tools and technologies used: Python 3
